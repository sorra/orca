# Orca
ORCA (Object Relational CApability) is an ORM framework for Java.
## Motivation
Why another framework, why not Hibernate (i.e. JPA)?

These are some of the advantages that inspire us to build Orca:
1. Orca supports low-code application development.
2. Hibernate is a stateful framework so you need to access data in the scope of an open session (i.e. PersistenceContext). Orca is a stateless framework so you can use it more easily.
3. Orca solves multiple performance issues of Hibernate like N+1 query and slow flush.
## Project Status
This project is in an early stage.
We are actively working to make it production ready.
MySQL and PostgreSQL will be supported first.

Supported features:
- entity metadata definition
- entity class generation
- DB schema generation
- CRUD
- associations (everything: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
- cascading
- finding by object navigation path. 
- Especially, it can handle circular associations (e.g. A->A and A->B->A).

Currently, its features are proven by unit tests and an example application.

You can check these code paths for what things it can do:
